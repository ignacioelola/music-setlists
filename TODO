TODO

- Third layer extraction on wikipeida is buggy, and the code should improve. Second extractor also don't extract correctly http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_blues_rock_musicians and make the app crash when training

- Connector to get links to the setlists (including pagination) 5d52fe9d-6dc5-4a56-b6cb-a0e5e65042c2
- Extractor to get songs from a setlist b1a10a4c-2be2-4266-a145-25ae51730627

- get artist page in discogs
- paginate to get all album links
- in each album extract all songs

Block 2 and 3 could use the same code: Connector + paginate chain API
