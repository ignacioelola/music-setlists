- Find list of artists (+ genres) 
  -> will use this as source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_musicians_by_genre
  guid1 = 0a7ccd62-377f-4b94-aca0-c74a78984b6b
  guid2 = 68f6efda-85f3-41f7-b252-77e1aadb7c3c
  guid3 = ff4c3352-0ba6-4428-8ec3-9c5b00d58aa8

  - Some lists of lists also contains lists (example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_blues_musicians_by_genre0 I need 3 levels extractor -> I will edit the existing APIs to get those links in a new column. Then get_musicians.py shoudl check if the new links column exist, and if so, do the extra query to get those results before passing all results to the save function.

- Search artist on setlist.fm, get artist page
- paginate to get all links to all set list in 2014
- get songs from all the set lists

- get artist page in discogs
- paginate to get all album links
- in each album extract all songs

Block 2 and 3 could use the same code: Connector + paginate chain API
